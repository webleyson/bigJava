How to 1.1
2 cars.  keep for 10 years
one is more fuel efficient and more expensive
you know the price and fuel efficiency of both cars
Â£4 per gallon
15,000 miles per year
write an algo for the better deal



STEP 1 - DETERMINE THE INPUTS

2 inputs

purchase price 1 and fuel efficiency 1
purchase price 2 and fuel efficiency 2



STEP 2 - BREAK IT DOWN

for each car we need to know the total cost of driving

purchase price + operating cost

operating cost depends on the cost of driving the car for 1 year

The operating cost:		10* annual fuel cost
annual fuel cost:		price per gallon * annual fuel consumed
annual fuel consumed: 	annual miles driven / fuel efficiency
eg if you drive 15,000 miles and the fuel efficiency is 15 miles/gallon the car consumes 1000 gallons.


STEP 3 - DESCRIBE EACH SUBTASK IN PSEUDO CODE
remember to compute any intermediate value before their needed.
